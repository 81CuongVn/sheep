# Privacy Policy
Sheep collects very little of your data. In order to function, these are the things that are collected and stored indefinitely:
- Anything you provide to the bot through commands. This primarily includes saved colors and configuration data
- Discord-provided server, user, and role IDs, as part of indexing roles, changing colors, and managing configurations
- Daily backups of the above

Most data can easily be deleted by using the proper command to delete it. Note that this will not remove data from any existing backups of it

If desired, you can contact us at (GS)#6969 on Discord or [join the support server](https://discord.gg/EvDmXGt) to ask us to remove any other data. This is also where we can be contacted about privacy concerns if necessary
