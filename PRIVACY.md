# Privacy Policy
## Collected data
Sheep collects very little of your data. In order to function, these are the things that are collected and stored indefinitely:
- Anything you provide to the bot through commands. This primarily includes saved colors and configuration data
- Discord-provided server, user, and role IDs, as part of indexing roles, changing colors, and managing configurations
- Daily backups of the above

## Storage and access
Data is stored using PostgreSQL on a secure and private server. The data is only accessible by the developers of the bot; no one else has been given access.

## Usage
Data collected by the bot is used in a few ways:
### Server IDs
Server IDs are used to differentiate roles across servers and store server-specific configuration.

### User IDs
User IDs are used to differentiate roles between users in a server, to store user-specific configuration, and to mark which saved colors belong to a user.

### Role IDs
Role IDs are stored to keep track of roles that are managed by the bot, ie. roles that can be or have been assigned to users using the bot's commands.

### Text provided through commands
Some data may be stored through commands, such as information relating to saved colors. This is used to differentiate and query saved colors, or to set configuration options.

## Removing data
Most data can easily be deleted by using the proper command to delete it. Note that this will not remove data from any existing backups of it, and that it is still possible to lose access to some data by leaving servers or removing the bot from your server.  
If you would like inaccessible data deleted, feel free to contact us using the information below.

## Contact
If desired, you can contact us at (GS)#6969 on Discord or [join the support server](https://discord.gg/EvDmXGt) to ask us to remove any other data. This is also where we can be contacted about privacy concerns if necessary.
